# minimatch

A minimal matching utility.

This is the matching library used internally by npm.

It works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`
objects.

## Usage

```js
// hybrid module, load with require() or import
import { minimatch } from 'minimatch'
// or:
const { minimatch } = require('minimatch')

minimatch('bar.foo', '*.foo') // true!
minimatch('bar.foo', '*.bar') // false!
minimatch('bar.foo', '*.+(bar|foo)', { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!
```

## Features

Supports these glob features:

- Brace Expansion
- Extended glob matching
- "Globstar" `**` matching
- [Posix character
  classes](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html),
  like `[[:alpha:]]`, supporting the full range of Unicode
  characters. For example, `[[:alpha:]]` will match against
  `'√©'`, though `[a-zA-Z]` will not. Collating symbol and set
  matching is not supported, so `[[=e=]]` will _not_ match `'√©'`
  and `[[.ch.]]` will not match `'ch'` in locales where `ch` is
  considered a single character.

See:

- `man sh`
- `man bash` [Pattern
  Matching](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html)
- `man 3 fnmatch`
- `man 5 gitignore`

## Windows

**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**

Though windows uses either `/` or `\` as its path separator, only `/`
characters are used by this glob implementation. You must use
forward-slashes **only** in glob expressions. Back-slashes in patterns
will always be interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.

Note that `\` or `/` _will_ be interpreted as path separators in paths on
Windows, and will match against `/` in glob expressions.

So just always use `/` in patterns.

### UNC Paths

On Windows, UNC paths like `//?/c:/...` or
`//ComputerName/Share/...` are handled specially.

- Patterns starting with a double-slash followed by some
  non-slash characters will preserve their double-slash. As a
  result, a pattern like `//*` will match `//x`, but not `/x`.
- Patterns staring with `//?/<drive letter>:` will _not_ treat
  the `?` as a wildcard character. Instead, it will be treated
  as a normal string.
- Patterns starting with `//?/<drive letter>:/...` will match
  file paths starting with `<drive letter>:/...`, and vice versa,
  as if the `//?/` was not present. This behavior only is
  present when the drive letters are a case-insensitive match to
  one another. The remaining portions of the path/pattern are
  compared case sensitively, unless `nocase:true` is set.

Note that specifying a UNC path using `\` characters as path
separators is always allowed in the file path argument, but only
allowed in the pattern argument when `windowsPathsNoEscape: true`
is set in the options.

## Minimatch Class

Create a minimatch object by instantiating the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.

```javascript
var Minimatch = require('minimatch').Minimatch
var mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)
```

### Properties

- `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.
- `options` The options supplied to the constructor.
- `set` A 2-dimensional array of regexp or string expressions.
  Each row in the
  array corresponds to a brace-expanded pattern. Each item in the row
  corresponds to a single path-part. For example, the pattern
  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:

        [ [ a, d ]
        , [ b, c, d ] ]

  If a portion of the pattern doesn't have any "magic" in it
  (that is, it's something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it
  will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular
  expression.

- `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method. A single regular expression
  expressing the entire pattern. This is useful in cases where you wish
  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.
- `negate` True if the pattern is negated.
- `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.
- `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.

### Methods

- `makeRe()` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary, and return it.
  Will return `false` if the pattern is invalid.
- `match(fname)` Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or
  false otherwise.
- `matchOne(fileArray, patternArray, partial)` Take a `/`-split
  filename, and match it against a single row in the `regExpSet`. This
  method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be
  used by a glob-walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.
- `hasMagic()` Returns true if the parsed pattern contains any
  magic characters. Returns false if all comparator parts are
  string literals. If the `magicalBraces` option is set on the
  constructor, then it will consider brace expansions which are
  not otherwise magical to be magic. If not set, then a pattern
  like `a{b,c}d` will return `false`, because neither `abd` nor
  `acd` contain any special glob characters.

  This does **not** mean that the pattern string can be used as a
  literal filename, as it may contain magic glob characters that
  are escaped. For example, the pattern `\\*` or `[*]` would not
  be considered to have magic, as the matching portion parses to
  the literal string `'*'` and would match a path named `'*'`,
  not `'\\*'` or `'[*]'`. The `minimatch.unescape()` method may
  be used to remove escape characters.

All other methods are internal, and will be called as necessary.

### minimatch(path, pattern, options)

Main export. Tests a path against the pattern using the options.

```javascript
var isJS = minimatch(file, '*.js', { matchBase: true })
```

### minimatch.filter(pattern, options)

Returns a function that tests its
supplied argument, suitable for use with `Array.filter`. Example:

```javascript
var javascripts = fileList.filter(minimatch.filter('*.js', { matchBase: true }))
```

### minimatch.escape(pattern, options = {})

Escape all magic characters in a glob pattern, so that it will
only ever match literal strings

If the `windowsPathsNoEscape` option is used, then characters are
escaped by wrapping in `[]`, because a magic character wrapped in
a character class can only be satisfied by that exact character.

Slashes (and backslashes in `windowsPathsNoEscape` mode) cannot
be escaped or unescaped.

### minimatch.unescape(pattern, options = {})

Un-escape a glob string that may contain some escaped characters.

If the `windowsPathsNoEscape` option is used, then square-brace
escapes are removed, but not backslash escapes. For example, it
will turn the string `'[*]'` into `*`, but it will not turn
`'\\*'` into `'*'`, because `\` is a path separator in
`windowsPathsNoEscape` mode.

When `windowsPathsNoEscape` is not set, then both brace escapes
and backslash escapes are removed.

Slashes (and backslashes in `windowsPathsNoEscape` mode) cannot
be escaped or unescaped.

### minimatch.match(list, pattern, options)

Match against the list of
files, in the style of fnmatch or glob. If nothing is matched, and
options.nonull is set, then return a list containing the pattern itself.

```javascript
var javascripts = minimatch.match(fileList, '*.js', { matchBase: true })
```

### minimatch.makeRe(pattern, options)

Make a regular expression object from the pattern.

## Options

All options are `false` by default.

### debug

Dump a ton of stuff to stderr.

### nobrace

Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.

### noglobstar

Disable `**` matching against multiple folder names.

### dot

Allow patterns to match filenames starting with a period, even if
the pattern does not explicitly have a period in that spot.

Note that by default, `a/**/b` will **not** match `a/.d/b`, unless `dot`
is set.

### noext

Disable "extglob" style patterns like `+(a|b)`.

### nocase

Perform a case-insensitive match.

### nocaseMagicOnly

When used with `{nocase: true}`, create regular expressions that
are case-insensitive, but leave string match portions untouched.
Has no effect when used without `{nocase: true}`

Useful when some other form of case-insensitive matching is used,
or if the original string representation is useful in some other
way.

### nonull

When a match is not found by `minimatch.match`, return a list containing
the pattern itself if this option is set. When not set, an empty list
is returned if there are no matches.

### magicalBraces

This only affects the results of the `Minimatch.hasMagic` method.

If the pattern contains brace expansions, such as `a{b,c}d`, but
no other magic characters, then the `Minimatch.hasMagic()` method
will return `false` by default. When this option set, it will
return `true` for brace expansion as well as other magic glob
characters.

### matchBase

If set, then patterns without slashes will be matched
against the basename of the path if it contains slashes. For example,
`a?b` would match the path `/xyz/123/acb`, but not `/xyz/acb/123`.

### nocomment

Suppress the behavior of treating `#` at the start of a pattern as a
comment.

### nonegate

Suppress the behavior of treating a leading `!` character as negation.

### flipNegate

Returns from negate expressions the same as if they were not negated.
(Ie, true on a hit, false on a miss.)

### partial

Compare a partial path to a pattern. As long as the parts of the path that
are present are not contradicted by the pattern, it will be treated as a
match. This is useful in applications where you're walking through a
folder structure, and don't yet have the full path, but want to ensure that
you do not walk down paths that can never be a match.

For example,

```js
minimatch('/a/b', '/a/*/c/d', { partial: true }) // true, might be /a/b/c/d
minimatch('/a/b', '/**/d', { partial: true }) // true, might be /a/b/.../d
minimatch('/x/y/z', '/a/**/z', { partial: true }) // false, because x !== a
```

### windowsPathsNoEscape

Use `\\` as a path separator _only_, and _never_ as an escape
character. If set, all `\\` characters are replaced with `/` in
the pattern. Note that this makes it **impossible** to match
against paths containing literal glob pattern characters, but
allows matching with patterns constructed using `path.join()` and
`path.resolve()` on Windows platforms, mimicking the (buggy!)
behavior of earlier versions on Windows. Please use with
caution, and be mindful of [the caveat about Windows
paths](#windows).

For legacy reasons, this is also set if
`options.allowWindowsEscape` is set to the exact value `false`.

### windowsNoMagicRoot

When a pattern starts with a UNC path or drive letter, and in
`nocase:true` mode, do not convert the root portions of the
pattern into a case-insensitive regular expression, and instead
leave them as strings.

This is the default when the platform is `win32` and
`nocase:true` is set.

### preserveMultipleSlashes

By default, multiple `/` characters (other than the leading `//`
in a UNC path, see "UNC Paths" above) are treated as a single
`/`.

That is, a pattern like `a///b` will match the file path `a/b`.

Set `preserveMultipleSlashes: true` to suppress this behavior.

### optimizationLevel

A number indicating the level of optimization that should be done
to the pattern prior to parsing and using it for matches.

Globstar parts `**` are always converted to `*` when `noglobstar`
is set, and multiple adjascent `**` parts are converted into a
single `**` (ie, `a/**/**/b` will be treated as `a/**/b`, as this
is equivalent in all cases).

- `0` - Make no further changes. In this mode, `.` and `..` are
  maintained in the pattern, meaning that they must also appear
  in the same position in the test path string. Eg, a pattern
  like `a/*/../c` will match the string `a/b/../c` but not the
  string `a/c`.
- `1` - (default) Remove cases where a double-dot `..` follows a
  pattern portion that is not `**`, `.`, `..`, or empty `''`. For
  example, the pattern `./a/b/../*` is converted to `./a/*`, and
  so it will match the path string `./a/c`, but not the path
  string `./a/b/../c`. Dots and empty path portions in the
  pattern are preserved.
- `2` (or higher) - Much more aggressive optimizations, suitable
  for use with file-walking cases:

  - Remove cases where a double-dot `..` follows a pattern
    portion that is not `**`, `.`, or empty `''`. Remove empty
    and `.` portions of the pattern, where safe to do so (ie,
    anywhere other than the . 
